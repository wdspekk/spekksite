        <h2>Ottawa-Carleton Transit System Exploits</h2>
        <p style="padding: 0 5%">
            The Ottawa-Carleton Transit System (Hereby mentionned as OCT) has been around since 1971, after it replaced the former system, the Ottawa-Carleton Transit Commission. Since then, it has seen multiple patches and updates, but also multiple exploitable bugs.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="padding: 0 5%">Examples:</h3>
        
        <ol style="padding: 0 10%">
            <li>Present on <b>Route 335 - The Fog:</b> When dismounting at The Fog, the bus will immediately <b>despawn</b>. The only way to get back is to <b>cheese</b> the bus spawn locations. By using the <b>bus tracker app</b>, speedrunners have been able to save 3 seconds in this segment.<br></li>
            <br>
            <li>Exploit at <b>Hurdman Station</b> and (occasionally, not consistently) <b>Lycée-Claudel Station:</b> If you clip outside of the map, you will reset to your character's default position in the external cell, allowing you to bypass <b>Route 88</b>, landing at <b>Baseline Station</b>.<br></li>
            <br>
            <li>You can clip between the train doors on <b>Trillium Line</b>, automatically forcing the next external cell to immediately load, saving more time on speedruns. This was found by user <b>_f^ckOCtransp0</b> on the <b>twingalaxies</b> forums in late 2004.<br></li>
            <br>
            <li>If a player <b>beelines</b> bacwards through the bus door while it opens while boarding at <b>Place d'Orléans, Rideau</b> or <b>Lincoln Fields Station,</b> the driver will be relocated to the <b>Operator's Breakroom</b> allowing you to board without the use of a <b>Presto Pass</b>.<br><i>Note: routes <b>12, 39</b> and <b>84</b> will continue regardless of the driver's presence. Routes <b>6, 33</b> and <b>11</b> will not move until the driver crosses the event boundary at the door. <b>Route 51</b> will cause a <b>fatal runtime error</b> if this bug is exploited.</i></li>
            <br>
            <li>A player can <b>backhop</b> through the escalator at <b>Rideau Subway Station</b>, allowing them to clip into the basement of the <b>McDonald's</b> restaurant at <b>99 Rideau Street</b> where he can find a <b>Gravity Gun</b>, heroin syringes and <b>raccoons</b>. Allowing a raccoon to cross the <b>event boundary</b> at <b>King Edward and Templeton</b> will trigger the <b>endgame sequence</b> while bringing it onto any <b>Route 63</b> bus will crash the game.<br></li>
            <br>
